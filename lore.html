  <h1>Sinbound Lore</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Chapter I: The One Who Watched</h2>
    <p>Before there was Sin, there was the Serathiel. He was not born but assigned, not named but numbered. N.-000, the Seamless One. His was the burden of observation, not judgment, and he carried it in silence across eons.</p>

    <h2>Chapter II: The Final Hour</h2>
    <p>N.999, the Final Hour, came not to act but to unmake. It watched time decay, and saw the Seamless One not act. When entropy touched will, the two numbers clashed — not in violence, but in paradox. Their battle left fractures in the firmament.</p>

    <h2>Chapter III: The Unbound Flame</h2>
    <p>A wanderer rose from ash and oathbreakers — immune to Sin, bound to none. They walk the Hellskein still. Their presence stirs the Sins, and the Seamless One watches once more.</p>

    <h2>Chapter IV: The Sinbound Thirteen</h2>
    <p>Thirteen figures claimed the power of Sin, each reshaping a domain within the Hellskein. They made pacts with mortals, bred Thralls, and turned engines of guilt into fuel. The Accord holds, but barely.</p>

    <h2>Chapter V: The Hollow Angel</h2>
    <p>They say Serathiel’s remnants dream. Deep in the Pale Hollow, a pulse grows louder. Some call it hope. Others, relapse.</p>

    <h2>Chapter VI: The Seamless One Stirs</h2>
    <p>It is said that the Seamless One was once Serathiel. Or perhaps Serathiel was only a mask. Either way, its six arms have begun to move.</p>
  </div>

  <h1>Species in Hell</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="species-entry">
      <h3>Hollowborn</h3>
      <p>Hollowborns are the beings of Guilt. Appearing wherever one feels shamed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="species-entry">
      <h3>Fleshweavers</h3>
      <p>These flesh-crafters of Gluttony shape matter by hunger and mutation. They fashion living weapons, bloated horrors, and a god that will cleanse all of Hell.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="species-entry">
      <h3>Ashwraiths</h3>
      <p>Ashwraiths are the souls of those who were wronged in life. When a spirit cannot let go of its pain, it ignites into flame, drifting through Hell as a smoldering ghost.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="species-entry">
      <h3>Brimstone Titans</h3>
      <p>Brimstone Titans are the oldest living things in Hell. Formed when the plane was still molten, they are walking mountains, crusted with obsidian and magma.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="species-entry">
      <h3>Chitterfiends</h3>
      <p>Chitterfiends weren’t supposed to exist. They emerged within Scythemite broods, smaller, with faces like carved bone and limbs serrated like meat hooks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="species-entry">
      <h3>Gravewings</h3>
      <p>They began as simple carrion beasts, but over time, exposure to cursed winds and the ash of ancient spells awakened a terrible intellect in them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="species-entry">
      <h3>Ironborns</h3>
      <p>The Ironborn were not born of Hell — they were made in it. Beings captured were twisted into metal-bodied war machines, fused with blades, armor, and engines of death.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="species-entry">
      <h3>Misery Imps</h3>
      <p>The Misery Imps were born from the first regrets ever felt in Hell — little ripples of despair that splintered off from damned souls and took shape.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="species-entry">
      <h3>Scornbeasts</h3>
      <p>Bred in the war pits of Hell’s blood arenas, Scornbeasts were once bestial gladiators. But over centuries of bloodshed, they learned to humiliate before the kill.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="species-entry">
      <h3>Scythemites</h3>
      <p>The Scythemites are towering insectoid reapers charged with enforcing Hell's laws.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="species-entry">
      <h3>Tariss</h3>
      <p>Native to the slick obsidian tunnels far below Hell’s molten crust, the Tariss are small hunters. But what they lack in size, they make up for in overwhelming numbers, hyper-coordination, and ambush instincts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="species-entry">
      <h3>Wyrmreapers</h3>
      <p>The Wyrmreapers were among the first to crawl through Hell. Ancient dragon-centipede hybrids, they were born from the eruption that first birthed the realm.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="species-entry">
      <h3>Ashenborn</h3>
      <p>Ashenborn are made of smoke, shadow, and memory. They came into existence during the first betrayals in Hell.</p>
    </div>
